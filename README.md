 **Overview of the Recommendation Engine Code:**
 
This Java program implements a Collaborative Filtering-based Recommendation Engine that suggests movies to a user based on the preferences of similar users.

**Key Features**

Dataset: A predefined set of users and their movie ratings.

Similarity Calculation: Uses Cosine Similarity to compare the target user's ratings with others.

**Recommendation:**

Finds users with the highest similarity to the target user.
Aggregates their ratings to recommend movies the target user hasnâ€™t seen.
Top-N Recommendations: Outputs the top N movies based on aggregated scores.
Flow

Input: The target user's name and the number of recommendations (topN).

Process:
Calculate similarity scores for other users.
Sort similar users in descending order.
Aggregate movie ratings from these similar users.
Output: A list of recommended movies.
